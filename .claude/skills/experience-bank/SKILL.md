description: >-
  Maintain Jacob's experience bank — the tagged claim store at
  artifacts/contributions/claims.yaml in the knowledge base. Use when adding, updating, tagging, or
  curating experience claims, when pulling new claims from the generated project summaries, or when
  enriching the non-technical side from the worklog. Triggers on "add a claim", "update the bank",
  "pull from the summaries", "enrich the bank from the worklog", "re-tag", "rebuild the bank index".

# Experience Bank

The bank (`~/Projects/brainspace/artifacts/contributions/claims.yaml`) is the source of truth for
Jacob's project experience. Documents (LinkedIn, resume, JD-tailored sets) are RENDERS over it — see
the `tailored-render` skill. This skill is for keeping the bank populated and accurate.

> **Paths.** The bank and its inputs live in the knowledge base, rooted at `~/Projects/brainspace/`
> (override with `$BRAINSPACE_ROOT`): summaries in `artifacts/project-summaries/`, the bank in
> `artifacts/contributions/`. Bare `claims.yaml` references below mean that file.

## The pipeline (don't skip a layer)

```text
data/ (git logs in git-logs/, CSVs in backlogs/)
  → project-summary skill                    →  artifacts/project-summaries/*   (generated)
      → EXTRACT (this skill)                 →  artifacts/contributions/claims.yaml   (the bank)
          → RENDER (tailored-render skill)   →  LinkedIn / resume / JD
```

Claims are pulled FROM `~/Projects/brainspace/artifacts/project-summaries/*`, the generated upstream
layer — not invented and not mined from raw logs directly. If a summary is missing or stale,
regenerate it first with the project-summary skill, then extract.

## No API

Generation is done by Claude Code directly (you are the model). Do not call the AI-SDK layer or any
API. Extraction = you reading a summary and writing claims.

## Claim schema

Each claim in `claims.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: <domain-prefix>-<short-slug>     # stable, unique
  type: technical | non-technical       # technical = mined from project data; non-technical = the "why"
  project: <internal-codename>          # NOT for output
  domain: <public-safe domain string>   # USE THIS in renders, never the client name
  themes: [technical leadership | system design | cross-domain adaptability | reliability | growth | devops/CI | i18n | testing]
  tech: [named technologies from the source only]   # usually [] for non-technical claims
  scope: IC | owned-feature | co-tech-lead
  strength: featured | solid | filler   # proposed default; Jacob adjusts at render time
  hook: true | false                    # a "I need to talk to this person" problem
  keyword_rich: >-                       # recruiter-facing, anonymized
    ...
  plain_language: >-                     # plain-English; "" if not yet written (fill for featured/hook)
    ...
  source: <worklog-filename>            # any worklog-sourced claim — the entry it came from (dedup key)
  agent_assisted: true | false          # set true if it came from an AI-assisted session log
```

**`type`** is a first-class split, surfaced as top-level groups in the index. It's orthogonal to
`source` (where the claim came from) and `agent_assisted` (whether an AI agent was involved):

- **`technical`** — *what was built*. Usually extracted from the project summaries (git logs /
  backlogs), with full `domain` / `tech` / `themes` detail. Can **also** come from a `/log-work`
  session log (the lightweight path for side/client projects that never get a summary) — tagged with
  its `source` so the two paths stay distinguishable.
- **`non-technical`** — decisions, mentoring, process, leadership — the "why" git can't show. Captured
  forward from the worklog (weekly summaries + `/log-work` session logs); `tech` is usually empty.

## Rules (non-negotiable)

- **Confidentiality:** never write a client or product name into the bank. Only "Atomic Object" may
  appear. Describe clients by DOMAIN (e.g. "a statewide court system", "a national coffee chain").
  Existing domain strings: `retail / consumer mobile`, `state judicial / government finance`,
  `global leadership-development / education`, `healthcare / clinical`.
- **Trace to source:** every `tech` tag and any number/metric must come from the summary. Never
  invent (this is the drift the old synthesizer caused — see specs/render-rules-reference.md).
- **No duplicates:** before adding, scan existing claim ids/topics for the project so you extend
  rather than repeat.
- **`themes` holds themes only** — never put a `scope` value (IC/owned-feature/co-tech-lead) in it.

## Need a summary first?

If `~/Projects/brainspace/artifacts/project-summaries/<project>-project-summary.md` doesn't exist
yet, generate it with the **`project-summary`** skill (data → summary), then extract claims from it
below.

## Adding claims from a summary

1. Read the relevant
   `~/Projects/brainspace/artifacts/project-summaries/<project>-project-summary.md` fully.
2. List the project's existing claims in `claims.yaml` so you don't duplicate.
3. Extract genuinely distinct accomplishments as claim blocks (schema above), anonymized. Claims
   pulled from a project summary are `type: technical`.
4. Append them under the right domain section of `claims.yaml`.
5. Rebuild the index: `bun run buildBankIndex`.

## Enrich from the worklog (technical + non-technical)

This is the **forward-capture path** for the bank — the "why" git can't show (decisions, mentoring,
process, leadership = `non-technical`) **and** the technical work from `/log-work` session logs that
may never get a full project summary (= `technical`, e.g. side/client projects). Triggered by "enrich
the bank from the worklog" and by the weekly review. Source: `~/Projects/brainspace/WorkLife/atomic/worklog/`.

1. **Scope the input.** Consider only genuine work reflections: weekly summaries (`*-summary.md`) and
   session logs (`type: session-log`, named `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-<slug>.md`). **Skip** agent handoff
   entries (frontmatter `type: handoff`) and `README.md` — process chatter, not career material.
2. **Skip what's already ingested.** Collect the `source:` values of **all** existing claims. Skip any
   worklog entry whose filename already appears as a `source:`. This is the real idempotency guard — it
   survives backfilled/out-of-order entries. (`meta.worklog_enriched_through` is just a cursor for
   where you left off; don't rely on it to dedup.)
3. **Extract** claims from each remaining entry — **`type: technical`** (what was built) and/or
   **`type: non-technical`** (a decision and why, who was mentored/unblocked, a process/leadership
   move). On every extracted claim set `source:` to the worklog filename, and carry
   `agent_assisted: true` if the entry's frontmatter says so. **Frame agent-assisted work at Jacob's
   altitude** — what he directed, decided, reviewed, integrated — never "I built X" when an agent did
   most of it. Anonymize per the confidentiality rules below and honor the worklog's NDA note. **Never
   invent** — if an entry is still a template/placeholder (unfilled `⟵ add …` prompts, no real content
   yet), treat it as **not yet written**: extract nothing, and in step 5 do **not** advance the
   watermark past it (it's pending Jacob's fill-in). The `source:` guard re-surfaces it once it has
   content.
4. **Get sign-off.** Propose the candidate claims in chat — Jacob approves, edits, or drops each.
   This is the quality gate; nothing is written without his ok.
5. **Write** the approved claims under the right domain (or a `working style / approach` style domain
   for cross-cutting ones), then advance `meta.worklog_enriched_through` to the latest date you
   **completed** — i.e. the newest entry you either extracted from or confirmed is genuinely
   complete-but-uneventful. Do **not** advance it over a still-unwritten template (see step 3). Then
   rebuild the index (`bun run buildBankIndex`). The watermark is advisory; the per-claim `source:` is
   the real dedup guard, so a thin entry left behind the watermark is still revisited correctly.

## Curating

Jacob curates conversationally, not by editing YAML. When he says "bump X to featured", "that's not a
hook", "add a claim about Y", make the edit in `claims.yaml` and rebuild the index. Strength/hook are
only filters for renders, so they don't need to be perfect up front.

## Atomic-only

The bank holds Atomic Object experience only — Jacob has no pre-Atomic professional experience to add.
