## Quality Checklist
- [ ] Summary is comprehensive enough to understand ${
		developer.name
	}'s full contribution
- [ ] Technical details are accurate and specific
- [ ] Professional achievements are clearly highlighted
- [ ] Content is structured for biography construction
- [ ] Language is professional and achievement-focused
- [ ] All major technical areas are covered
- [ ] Skills section captures both technical and leadership abilities
- [ ] Document structure EXACTLY matches the required template format
- [ ] Consistent formatting has been maintained with previous summaries
- [ ] All sections and subsections are present in the correct order

## Critical Quality Requirements

### Content Requirements
- Summary must be comprehensive enough to understand ${
		developer.name
	}'s full technical contribution
- Technical details must be accurate, specific, and extracted from commit evidence
- Professional achievements must be clearly highlighted with supporting evidence
- Content must be structured specifically for professional biography construction
- Language must be professional, achievement-focused, and action-oriented
- All major technical areas must be thoroughly covered with specific examples
- Skills section must capture both deep technical capabilities and leadership abilities

### Structure Requirements (CRITICAL)
- Document structure must EXACTLY match the required template format
- Consistent formatting must be maintained with all previous summaries
- All sections and subsections must be present in the exact order specified
- Each section must contain substantial, detailed content - no placeholder text
- Bullet points must follow the exact **[Title]** [description] format
- Technical terms must be bolded consistently

### Analysis Depth Requirements
- Extract specific technical implementations from commit messages
- Identify architectural patterns and design decisions
- Highlight complex problem-solving and innovative solutions
- Demonstrate technical growth and learning throughout the project
- Show evidence of technical leadership and collaboration
- Quantify impact and contributions where possible from commit evidence

This analysis must produce a professional-grade summary that demonstrates ${
		developer.name
	}'s technical expertise, problem-solving abilities, and professional growth through concrete evidence extracted from their ${recordCount} ${
		isGitData ? "commits" : "tasks"
	} on the ${project.name} project.

## CRITICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

**The structure, format, and organization of all summaries must be IDENTICAL across projects.** This means:

1. **Exact same section headings** in the exact same order
2. **Identical formatting** for developer information, bullet points, and emphasis
3. **Consistent writing style** across all documents
4. **Same organizational pattern** within each section
5. **Uniform styling** of technical terms and concepts

Any deviation from the established template format is considered a critical error. When generating summaries, always refer to previously created summaries to ensure complete consistency in structure and formatting. The goal is to create a collection of professional summaries that can be read side-by-side with identical organization and structure.`;
