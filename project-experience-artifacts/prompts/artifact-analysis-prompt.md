### Quality Checklist
- [ ] Summary is comprehensive enough to understand the developer's full contribution
- [ ] Technical details are accurate and specific
- [ ] Professional achievements are clearly highlighted
- [ ] Content is structured for biography construction
- [ ] Language is professional and achievement-focused
- [ ] All major technical areas are covered
- [ ] Skills section captures both technical and leadership abilities
- [ ] Document structure EXACTLY matches the required template format
- [ ] Consistent formatting has been maintained with previous summaries
- [ ] All sections and subsections are present in the correct order

## Optional Career Context

You can optionally replace `[OPTIONAL_CAREER_CONTEXT]` with career stage information to help tailor the summary tone and focus. Examples:

**For Mid-Level Developer Transitioning to Tech Lead:**
```
Career Context: [Developer Name] is a mid-level developer with strong technical expertise who is transitioning into technical leadership roles. Please emphasize emerging leadership capabilities, architectural contributions, and mentoring activities while highlighting their technical competence and growth trajectory.
```

**For Senior Developer:**
```
Career Context: [Developer Name] is an experienced senior developer with deep technical expertise. Please emphasize their technical leadership, architectural decision-making, and cross-team collaboration skills.
```

**For Junior Developer:**
```
Career Context: [Developer Name] is an early-career developer demonstrating strong technical aptitude and growth. Please emphasize learning agility, technical contributions, and collaborative skills while highlighting areas of emerging expertise.
```

Leave this section blank or remove `[OPTIONAL_CAREER_CONTEXT]` entirely if you prefer the analysis to focus purely on demonstrated work without career stage assumptions.

## Data Filtering

Replace `[FILTER_IDENTIFIERS]` with specific identifiers to help locate the developer's work in the artifact. Examples:

**For Git Logs:**
```
Data Filtering: Look for commits by "[Full Name]", "[username]", or email "[email@example.com]". Also include any commits mentioning "[initials]" or "[first name]" in commit messages.
```

**For CSV/Backlogs (if not pre-filtered):**
```
Data Filtering: Filter by username "[username]" in Members column, or "[Full Name]" in any name fields. Include any items assigned to or commented on by [Developer Name].
```

**For Mixed Data:**
```
Data Filtering: Look for "[username]", "[Full Name]", "[email@company.com]", or any variations of "[first name]" or "[initials]" in contributor fields, comments, or attribution data.
```

Note: For pre-filtered data, you can omit this section or note that filtering has already been completed.

## Usage Instructions

### For Git Logs
```
Please analyze the attached git log file for [DEVELOPER_NAME]'s contributions to [PROJECT_NAME]. 
Create a comprehensive summary following the artifact analysis framework, focusing on:
- Technical implementations and architectural decisions visible in commit messages
- Feature development patterns and areas of expertise
- Code quality and development process improvements
- Timeline and scope of contributions

[OPTIONAL_PROJECT_CONTEXT]

[OPTIONAL_CAREER_CONTEXT]

Data Filtering: [FILTER_IDENTIFIERS]
Output Directory: [OPTIONAL_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] (if not specified, use default: project-experience-summaries)
Data Input: [FILENAME]
```

### For CSV/JSON Backlogs
```
Please analyze the attached project backlog data for [DEVELOPER_NAME]'s work on [PROJECT_NAME].
Create a comprehensive summary following the artifact analysis framework, focusing on:
- Feature development and technical implementation work
- Bug resolution and quality assurance activities
- Technical leadership and architectural contributions
- Cross-functional collaboration and project management

[OPTIONAL_PROJECT_CONTEXT]

[OPTIONAL_CAREER_CONTEXT]

Data Filtering: The data has been pre-filtered to include only [DEVELOPER_NAME]'s assigned work items.
Output Directory: [OPTIONAL_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] (if not specified, use default: project-experience-summaries)
Data Input: [FILENAME]
```

### For Mixed Artifact Types
```
Please analyze the provided [ARTIFACT_TYPE] for [DEVELOPER_NAME]'s professional contributions to [PROJECT_NAME].
Create a comprehensive summary following the artifact analysis framework, extracting:
- Technical expertise demonstrated
- Leadership and mentoring activities
- Problem-solving and innovation examples
- Professional skills and competencies shown

[OPTIONAL_PROJECT_CONTEXT]

[OPTIONAL_CAREER_CONTEXT]

The summary should be detailed enough for constructing a professional biography showcasing their technical expertise and contributions.

Output Directory: [OPTIONAL_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY] (if not specified, use default: project-experience-summaries)
Data Input: [FILENAME]
```

## Success Criteria
The resulting summary should enable someone to:
1. Understand the developer's specific technical contributions and professional growth
2. Identify their areas of expertise and technical leadership capabilities
3. Recognize their problem-solving abilities and approach to complex technical challenges
4. Appreciate the scope and complexity of their professional work
5. See evidence of their technical competencies and collaborative skills
6. Extract relevant details for professional biography construction
7. Compare multiple developer project summaries with consistent structure and format

## CRITICAL CONSISTENCY REQUIREMENTS

**The structure, format, and organization of all summaries must be IDENTICAL across projects.** This means:

1. **Exact same section headings** in the exact same order
2. **Identical formatting** for developer information, bullet points, and emphasis
3. **Consistent writing style** across all documents
4. **Same organizational pattern** within each section
5. **Uniform styling** of technical terms and concepts

Any deviation from the established template format is considered a critical error. When generating summaries, always refer to previously created summaries to ensure complete consistency in structure and formatting. The goal is to create a collection of professional summaries that can be read side-by-side with identical organization and structure.

This prompt framework ensures consistent, comprehensive analysis that captures the full scope of professional expertise and contributions across different types of project artifacts.
